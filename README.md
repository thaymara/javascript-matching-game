# Matching Game
An interactive game using javaScript

# The Task 

This assessment task requires you to make an interactive game. Please see the accompanying video for an example walk-through. Some of the skills in this assessment task are demonstrated in the Example DOM Project, and the code for that project has been released in the system. You are recommended to look at that project and understand it prior to starting this assessment task.  

When the game starts, five faces are shown on the left and four are shown on the right.
The left and right sides are identical, except for one thing: the left side has one extra face. The user needs to click on that extra face. If anything except the correct face is clicked, a message is displayed saying that the game is over. If the correct face is clicked, all the currently displayed faces are deleted and a new set of faces is shown at random positions. Each time a new set of faces is shown there will be 5 more faces than before, on both the left and the right sides. There will always be one extra face shown on the left.

For example, letâ€™s imagine you are playing the game shown in the previous figure. After clicking on the extra face (at the top) all the faces disappear and the following new set of faces are shown. As you can see, on both sides 5 more faces than before are shown.

After playing the game by correctly clicking on the extra face many times, a lot of faces will be shown.
